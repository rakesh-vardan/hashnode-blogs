[Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/what-is-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery/) (CI/CD) has become an essential part of modern software development cycles. As a part of continuous integration, the developer should ensure that the Integration does not break the existing code because this could lead to a negative impact on the overall quality of the project. In order to show how the integration process works, weâ€™ll take an example of a well-known continuous integration tool, [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/). In this article, we will learn TeamCity concepts and integrate our test suites with TeamCity for [test automation](https://www.lambdatest.com/automation-testing) by leveraging LambdaTest's [cloud-based Selenium grid](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation).

There are numerous [best CI/CD tools](https://www.lambdatest.com/learning-hub/cicd) available for building high-quality code and narrowing the gap between development and impacted teams. Besides establishing a DevOps culture in the organizations, teams enhance it by implementing [best CI/CD practices](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/16-best-practices-of-ci-cd-pipeline-to-speed-test-automation/) throughout the Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC). These practices help the teams accelerate product development, automate processes, and improve overall productivity.
