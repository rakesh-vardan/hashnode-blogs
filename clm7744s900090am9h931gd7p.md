With the help of well-designed Continuous Integration systems in place, teams can build quality software by developing and verifying it in smaller increments. [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/what-is-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery/) is the process of pushing small sets of code changes frequently to the common integration branch rather than merging all the changes at once. This avoids big-bang integration before a product release. [Test automation](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) and Continuous Integration are an integral part of the software development life cycle. As the benefits of following DevOps methodology in a development team become significant, teams have started using different tools and libraries like Travis CI with Docker to accomplish this activity.

In this blog, we will discuss the role of Travis CI in Selenium test automation and dive deep into using Travis CI with Docker. We will also look at some effective Travis CI and Docker examples. We would also integrate and [automate Selenium test suites with Travis CI](https://www.lambdatest.com/automate-selenium-tests-with-travisci) on the LambdaTest cloud grid.
