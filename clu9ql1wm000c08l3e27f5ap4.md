I am happy to share that I passed the [**AI-900**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification) exam recently with a score of 928/1000. Here are some inputs from my experience, that might be helpful to anyone planning for the same.

### **The below materials helped with my exam preparation:**

1. Microsoft Official [Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/ai-900/) - good material with all basics & hands-on labs on Azure. *A* *must-read for everyone.*
    
2. AI-900 full course by ExamPro - available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwZHNH8EfSU) - 4hrs video - some of the concepts are outdated, due to service name changes in Azure. But gives a detailed outlook in a short time.
    
3. Cheat-sheet from [Whizcards](https://www.whizlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AI-900-whizcards.pdf) for a quick refresher before the exam - some of the concepts are outdated, due to service name changes in Azure.
    

### **Practice tests:**

1. Official practice [tests](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/ai-900/practice/assessment?assessmentId=26&assessment-type=practice) from MS ~200+ questions (tried multiple times, with some repeated questions though)
    
2. Practice [questions](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/ai-900/view/1/) from ExamTopics Â ~120 questions with a free account - some of these appeared in the actual exam!
    

### **Exam experience:**

1. I chose to attempt from a test center near where I live.
    
2. There are a total of **42** questions that need to be answered in **45** minutes. We need to manage time effectively. Got different question types - selecting a single answer, multiple answers, drag-drop, etc.
    
3. The first 5-6 questions were very tricky, with lengthy descriptions & images - which will waste our time. Though there are very simple questions at the end of the exam!
    
4. Minimum 3-4 questions from Responsible AI in Azure - very important topic.
    
5. Some questions around - OpenAI/AzureOpenAI/ChatGPT/Github Co-pilot/LLM models from OpenAI.
    
6. As usual, we can mark any question for review and check later - the best option is to cover all the questions at least once in the given time frame.
    
7. Given my preparation, I felt the test was of medium complexity.

All the best with your preparation!
