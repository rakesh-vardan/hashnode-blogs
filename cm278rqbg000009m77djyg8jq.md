In todayâ€™s fast-paced, digital-first world, itâ€™s all too easy to lose control of your time. As a software engineer, my day revolves around optimizing processes, but when it comes to my personal time management, I find myself slipping. Hours were lost on Instagram reels, YouTube shorts, and endless LinkedIn scrolling. These moments of distraction had a profound effect on my productivity and mental well-being. Thatâ€™s when I discovered [*Regain*](https://regainapp.ai/).

### The Turning Point

Recognizing that my productivity was taking a hit due to excessive screen time, I knew I needed to regain control. I decided to give *Regain* a try, a mobile app designed to manage and monitor mobile usage. The change was immediateâ€”and it went beyond just limiting screen time.

### How "Regain" Works

The app is built around empowering users to regain control over their digital habits. It offers features like daily time limits for specific apps, scheduled notifications, and usage tracking. But what sets it apart is how it addresses the psychological triggers that keep us hooked to our phones. Hereâ€™s how it worked for me:

* **Scheduled Notifications for Mindful Breaks**: *Regain* allows me to schedule notifications that remind me to take breaks productively. Instead of aimlessly browsing social media during these breaks, I now spend that time on healthier activitiesâ€”such as quick stretches, meditation, or a walk. This has helped me rewire how I approach relaxation, and it has had a noticeable effect on my mental clarity.
    
* **Dopamine and Cortisol Control**: The constant consumption of short, entertaining contentâ€”like reels and shortsâ€”triggers dopamine spikes, which leads to the urge for more content, ultimately creating a cycle of addiction. At the same time, the stress of falling behind on work or personal goals releases cortisol, the "stress hormone." *Regain* has helped break this cycle. By limiting my screen time and reducing over-stimulation, Iâ€™ve been able to stabilize both dopamine and cortisol levels. This balance has not only improved my focus but also reduced feelings of anxiety and stress.
    

### My Experience

Before *Regain*, I wasnâ€™t fully aware of how much time I was losing to mindless browsing. The app's ability to set daily usage limits has transformed my routine. Now, Iâ€™m greeted with a reminder when I approach my limits for apps like Instagram and YouTube, encouraging me to shift my focus back to work or more meaningful activities.

In just a few weeks, I've noticed profound changesâ€”not just in my productivity but also in my overall mood. With less time spent on social media, Iâ€™ve found myself less agitated and more centred throughout the day.

### Key Features That Made a Difference

* **Custom Time Limits**: Setting daily caps on apps helped me curb unnecessary screen time. I could limit apps like YouTube and LinkedIn without having to cut them off entirely.
    
* **Scheduled Notifications**: This feature allowed me to receive timely reminders to pause and engage in more mindful activities, preventing burnout.
    
* **Dopamine Regulation**: By reducing quick-hit content consumption, Iâ€™ve become less dependent on constant entertainment and more focused on long-term goals.
    
* **Cortisol Reduction**: Less time spent in front of a screen helped reduce stress, allowing me to manage my workload without feeling overwhelmed.
    

### Final Thoughts

Since I started using *Regain*, Iâ€™ve regained control of both my screen time and mental well-being. Cutting back on social media and video reels has reduced my dopamine dependency, and in turn, my cortisol levels have decreased, leaving me feeling more balanced and less anxious. Iâ€™m more productive, focused, and able to handle the demands of my role with greater ease.

If youâ€™re looking for a way to take charge of your time and improve your focus, I highly recommend trying *Regain*. For me, it has been the key to better time management, increased productivity, and improved mental health.
